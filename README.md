Revamped [my old workout-tracking application](https://github.com/orangejenny/workouts) with D3, largely-vanilla JavaScript, and a little bit of Perl.

* List of workouts by date, with details and notes
* Stores most recent sets of details for easier data entry
* Aggregates total activity and fastest/heaviest activity over the past year
* Visualization of frequency and type over the past year
